README for Application

- Cannot fill the boats unless it has been at least 24 hours before the row is scheduled to occur.
- Autofills the rowers based on sides, it includes ambi rowers in both sides.
- To use google calendars, it must have the googlecalendar gem installed.

To send reminders to users, set up a cron task that runs every day (it looks for events on the next day) that calls

#{RAILS_ROOT}script/runner -e production "User.email_reminders"

Inputting tide files uses xtide files (http://www.flaterco.com/xtide/)

An example is:

tide -l "South Freeport, Casco Bay, Maine" -b "2009-01-01 00:00" -e "2009-12-31 23:59" -ml 2.05ft -o tides.txt
 
To-Do List:
- Would like to make changes to have tides optional as a config variable
- Create README
